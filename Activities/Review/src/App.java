        //Q1 Make an variable to hold an integer and assign it a random value


        //Q2 Print out the integer


        //Q3 Print out the integer doubled


        //Q4 Increment the integer.


        //Q5 Make a double variable and assign it the variable you made in Q1


        //Q6 Add 3.67 to the double variable.


        //Q7 Store the new double in the variable from Q1. (make sure to cast)


        //Q8 Make a boolean that records whether the integer is less than 7.

        //Q9 Make a booolean that records whether the integer is less than 17.

        //Q10 Make a boolean that records whether the integer is less than or equal to 16, and is also an even number

        //Q11 Make a boolean that records whether the integer is a multiple of 5 or is not a multiple of 3

        //Q12 If the integer is greater than 7, print out "Hello"
        //If it is equal to 7, print out "Goodbye"
        //Otherwise print out "Bonjour"


        //Q13 Make an array of 6 integers (fill it with some numbers)

        //Q14 If the 1st number is odd and the 2nd number is even, print out "Yes"
        //If both are even, print out "Maybe"
        //If both are odd, print out "Maybe not"
        //Otherwise, print out "No"


        //Q15 Double the 3rd number until it is greater than 1000.


        //Q16 Repeatedly subtract 5 from the 4th number until it is negative


        //Q17 Using a for loop, print out all the numbers in the array


        //Q18 Using a for loop, print out all the numbers that aren't a multiple of 3 in the array


        //Q19 Count from -10 to 10



        //Q20 Make a string array of any size and fill it with city names


        //Q21 Print out all the city names that are longer than 7 letters

        //Q22 Change all of the city names to "Toronto"


        //NOTE: Make all your methods outside the main method

        //Q23 Make a method that takes in an integer and returns a true/false depending on if the number is even

        //Q24 Make a method that takes in an array of integers and doubles them until all numbers are greater than 1000.

        //Q25 Make a method that takes in an integer N, and returns an array of the first N even numbers


        //You're finished!
