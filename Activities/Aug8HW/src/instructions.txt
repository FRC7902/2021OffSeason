1. Create a new file with a new class called Tree
2. Give Tree a couple of attributes (at least one public, protected, private, and static attribute each) 
Don't assign any values to the attributes yet
3. Give Tree a constructor, where some attributes are assigned based on arguments passed in, and some attributes are assign constant values. (you decide)
4. Give Tree a couple of methods which print out Tree's attributes (maybe it introduces itself)

In App.java
1. Create a Tree object, passing the appropriate data types in the constructor
2. Directly access and print out some of the object's attributes
3. Change one of the object's attributes
4. Run some of the object's methods
5. Use encapsulation to print out a private attribute
6. Use encapsulation to change a private attribute

1. Create a new package (make sure it's in src)
2. Create a new file with a class in the package
3. Give the class a couple of attributes and methods 
4. Create an object of the class in App.java 


BONUS
In App.java, create a method which accepts an array with 4 integer values (the x coord of the bottom-left corner, y coord of the bottom-left corner, width, height), describing a rectangle 
and returns an array with 2 integer values (the x coord of the center of the rectangle, the y coord of the center of the rectangle)
