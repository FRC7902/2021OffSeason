        //Q1 Make an if statement (including else if and else) that does the following
        // If the age is less than 16, print "you can't drive yet"
        // If the age is exactly 16, print "You can start learning to drive"
        // If the age is greater than 16, print "You can learn to drive"
        int age = 15;








        //Q2 Using a ternary operator, print "YES" or "NO" if the person is an adult (age is at least 18)
        // The template is given to you
        System.out.println((true) ? "Something" : "Something");







        //Q3 Using a while loop, count from 1 to 20 (print it out)



        //Q4 Using a while loop, count down from 20 to 1 (print it out)





        //Q5 Using one while loop, count from 1 to 50 but:
        // - if the count is less than 25, print out the count squared 
        // - otherwise, print out the count multiplied by -1

        //NOTE: Don't do anything to the count except increment it




        //BONUS
        //Remember how chars can be represented using integers?
        //Using a while loop, print out the entire lowercase alphabet
        //You can refer to things if you need help (though it is possible to not refer to the chart)
